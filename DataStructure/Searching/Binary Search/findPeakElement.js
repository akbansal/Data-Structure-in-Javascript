/* Find a peak element
   Given an array of integers. Find a peak element in it. An array element is peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbors.
   For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor. For example, for input array {5, 10, 20, 15}, 20 is the only
   peak element. For input array {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}, there are two peak elements: 20 and 90. Note that we need to
   return any one peak element.

   Second Varient - what about finding a milimal element.
